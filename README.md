# Blood Lipid Profile Test Data Generator

## Introduction
A complete cholesterol test is also called a lipid panel or lipid profile. It's used by medical professional to measure the amount of “good” and “bad” cholesterol and triglycerides, a type of fat, in your blood.
Too much cholesterol can lead to:

1. heart disease
2. stroke
3. atherosclerosis, a clogging or hardening of your arteries

What Does a Cholesterol Test Measure?

A complete cholesterol test measures four types of lipids, or fats, in your blood:

1. Total cholesterol: This is the total amount of cholesterol in your blood.
2. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: This is referred to as “bad” cholesterol. Too much of it raises your risk of heart attack, stroke, and atherosclerosis.
3. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol: This is referred to as “good” cholesterol because it helps remove LDL cholesterol from your blood.
4. Triglycerides: When you eat, your body converts the calories it doesn’t need into triglycerides, which are stored in your fat cells. People who are overweight, diabetic, eat too many sweets, or drink too much alcohol can have high triglyceride levels.[1]
